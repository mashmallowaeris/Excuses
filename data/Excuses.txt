My mom was being weird and forced me not to do homeworkMy dad called and he told me that life was fake so I thought i wouldn’t do homework, blame my dadMy house burnt down so I had to cool it down a bitAn airplane crashed outside on my garden and I had to clean up everythingMy laptop is brokenI don’t have Wi-Fi at homeI don’t have a houseI didn’t do my homework because I’m mentally challenged I’m not KoreanI didn’t know we had homeworkI have memorizing problemsDon’t show up to classMy family diedI have cancerMy mom has been raped and I had to save herI was in the bathroom the whole timeI was tiredSports are tiringNo comment My uncle was actually a serial killer and almost killed meI was watching a movieDeal with itI hate schoolI don’t want anybody to see my work
My body is in pain
